# Configuration for the RGB LED on the ESP8266
#
# Used substitutions:
#
# - led_pin_red: pin connected to the red LED
# - led_pin_green: pin connected to the green LED
# - led_pin_blue: pin connected to the blue LED
#
# IDs used outside this file:
#
# - led_rgb: the RGB light

# The red, green and blue components don't have the same brightness.
# This takes into account:
# - the different current through each component
# - the common gamma correction (2.8)
